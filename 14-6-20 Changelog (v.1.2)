1.2 

This is the first real Changelog update since this is when it was added to GitHub (I forgot I’m sorry), I just felt obligated to sloppily put together sections for 1.0 and 1.1
We’ll go through the code from top to bottom and highlight changes

Added A ___ says ___ rights sections
Added an Inanimate Insanity category for all existing scenarios 
            ..."#BFDI# says #Rights# rights!",
        "I ship #Inanimate Insanity# x #Inanimate Insanity#",
        "I hate #Inanimate Insanity# x #Inanimate Insanity#",
        "#Inanimate Insanity# is #Headcannon#",
        "#Inanimate Insanity# says #Rights# rights!"
    ]...

Added (BFB) to Taco’s alias to not confuse her with Taco from Inanimate Insanity
